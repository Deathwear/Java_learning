/*
Approach: 
we need to take two input in the for loop:
[i] for current number
[j] for comparing between them 
and initialize an array and list.add the values for every [i] element compare
basically,
we are comparing every i in j loop for other numbers if jth value is greater we will do count++
add that count value in the initialised array.
and then return that array.
